-----------------------------

Sessions:
- what is it
- disable?
- usefulness?
- correctness?

Lists:
+ do they fucking work?
- but what about list updates?
- Add more lists?

+ www.dobin.ch?a=b
  + lists work?
  + xss work?
+ Notification: do not fucking use skull icon!

Network:
- cancelation work for real?

SQL:
- what tests are performed?

Clean that shit up:
- move "Payload add right" to options "XSS" or something
- "Session" Really works?

Fuzzdb oracle: first line fucked up?

clean up categorize:
- nicer buttons etc

-----------------------------

- add: host: header
- add: browser ident header atk
- add: empty param atk
- file path traversal shizzle

------------------------------

csnc test:

- XSS in tag is somewhat broken?
  <a id="ctl84_ContactsGridView_ctl11_lkbGVRow" href="javascript:__doPostBack('ctl84$ContactsGridView$ctl11$lkbGVRow','')">testXssaf"=&nbsp;test</a>

- add \' test?
- highlight name/value in panelleft should show it completely (overlong strings...)

-------------------

at defcon:
- autoscroll feature? (upon sending request, always select newest one)

-------------------

burp xtension itself:
- add categorizer / error indicators to normal requests?
- add additional window to burp responses:
  - indicator: show a bit of error messages
  - version: show versions

-------------------

- panelleft: color scanned params?
- panelright popup:
  - attack vector
  - categorizer / error details
  - attack result: show popup with details - jump to issue when clicked?
  - categorizer: show popup with details - jump to issue when clicked?
  - result: add and show result in attackresult
  - info: add and show result in categoryentry

- export:
  - copy paste csnc style
  - interoperability style

- implement file list scanner
- implement existing file "fuzzer"

- add version information on passive scanner? 

-------------------

- add param option: attack with sentinel
- test and identify multipart problems?
- test and identify copy paste problems


- always highlight parameter string?
- scanning is pretty slow if original request is 30kb
- for slow scanns: indicate which requests are scanned in toppanel
- possible to color things in panelright
- apply regex on categorizer takes very long. UI indicator or speedup?
- quick attack: attack each parameter once, to try to identify params which have any influence on the output
+ does disable/enable relative sizes even work?
  - make it apply all requests (also previous, not only new)
- implement the "interesting" param
  - on top on panelright?
- follow scan option
- show only "diff" of parameters in panelright? !!!
- double sql detection -> aggregate

-------------------

- empty go: just send it again
- HTTP 1.0 response without content-length -> nach body in hex

- want from portswigger:
  - send to sentinel should include text highlights
  - store stuff in session
  - if user selects text in repeater, it should be accessible from extension

- A2 authentication
  - set session name
  - identify session id in non-usual places
  - session attacks

- Parameter Pollution
  - add arbitrary param
- json viewer
- json browser
  - for adding params
  - test if its type is really JSON?

- standalone sentinel version
  - fix params in testmessages not showing up
  - create repeater implementation

- lists:
  ? should be possible to add decoded string for attack lists (xss)
  - list entries are usually not encoded - need to encode if sent in GET?
  - in GET - encode as + or %20?
  - or not?


- XSS placeholder in AttackList etc. ok?

- make decoder indicator better (no string)
  - also in panelright (attack)
- insert fucked up json delimiter on attackother };

- allow multiple changeParam in HttpParam?
- remove changeparam from httpMessage.getReq()?

- remove old selections in PanelLeftPopup.decodeIt()
- possibility to delete virtparam in panelleft for the user



- fix sql2 attack? 1'' -> fail -> 1' || '
  + updates sql with comments
  - attack options for sql injection?
  - lists; per db, per query
  - export to sqlmap
- do different sql attacks based on:
  - replace
  - insert right
  - insert left?

Overall:
- generate report
- add tooltip to everything
- attack variable names?
- adding a message is a little bit strange because of onaddrow on topview
- tab name should "blink" if sent to sentinel
  - how to?
- log window - popup on mouseover?
- manually follow 302 with button

Feature:

- copy-paste should be colorful! (and working...)
- implement session manager for burp

Bugfixes:
- change background color of lines of header, bold interesting one's

Todo CSNC:
- search: auto scroll to match
  - combobox?
  - popupmenu
- smart request copy
  - copy only relevant parts of request/response (viewstate nooot), with highlights
- session manager: make it global, add tab to request/reponse tab?
- make session ui more usable
  + remove a session
  - session from burp

- color backgrounds of buttons according to vuln (red, yellow)
? make go button in table

Todo HOME:
Main usability features:
- beautify modifies source, breaks attacks
- change index scroll thingies to line number, not offset whereever possible
- reset message header info upon changing to request?
- adjust syntax parser to highlight params
- fix urldecode on rightpanel
- implement other tooltips
- make color choosable
  - fix selection color
- select part of response to indicate stuff

- color attack backgrounds
  - (new)
  - tested          green
  - vulnerable      yellow
  - interesting     red
- make tooltip urldecode / or opposite correctly
- tooltips header/body
- limit view to successful attacks only 


attackother:
  - move GET to post/nonurlencoded (optional)
  - add GET to post/nonurlenced (optional)


Sunday test 0:
- cleanup attackresult / attackdata
  - where to store the enum?
  - isSuccess() to the enum?
- upon remove() message, also remove bot shit
- upon remove() message, do not adjust index #

Monday test 0:
- row width fÃ¼r attack/retlen: automatisch berechnen (minimal)
- make load time relative to initial?
- when resizing bot split pane - how keep it for next requests?
- burp: on parameters, only on click will combobox be available - make this too?
- request: for ?a&b&c, abc are not names, but values!


Internal test 0:
- move vulns to params, not messages (to cleanup hasVulns in panelleftui)


Big features:
  - important param
  - generate overall report
  - only view tags/content/all
  - if no answer on sending request, how to display?
  - translate to new menu interface
  - usually set parent in topui/botui for interface with gui - maybe global?
  
  
Think:
  - httpmessage: set parent in constructor?
  - replace orig param, or add attack?
  - if XSS0 ok and XSS1 ok, why still display XSS0?
  - highlight ALL params in leftui?
  - on redirectds - should request be initial request, or request of redir?


Questions:
  - invokelater for maingui?
  - invokelater for sendtosentinel?
